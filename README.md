In your app there are also two functions to handle button interaction: onButtonPressed(button) and onButtenReleased(button). These functions are called when a button is pressed or released, the button variable holds the actual button that is pressed or released. The button can have of the following values:
-	Button.UP
-	Button.DOWN
-	Button.LEFT
-	Button.RIGHT
-	Button.A
-	Button.B

In the functions you can easily check if a specific button was pressed by using an if statement like this: if (button === Button.UP).
